# Netflix-Shows-Python-Project
  For this project, I wanted to attempt to use Python in order to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data of a [Netflix dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows) that features 8807 rows and 12 columns. In this project, I utilized numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and wordcloud to illustrate what type of content that Netflix has on its platform to get an understanding of the current trends and interest that make Netflix so successful. This could be helpful to potential stakeholders who have an interest on producing a movie or tv series on Netflix.

  This project tells a story through the various comments and visualizations that I have done to make it easy to see and understand. With the data, I asked myself questions about each column provided and looked at frequent qualities that make up the majority of the content found on Netflix. Although they are frequent qualities, it doesn't necessarily make them popular. But working with what we have in this dataset, we can get an idea of what type of content consumers enjoy and learn about what's actually available on Netflix.
